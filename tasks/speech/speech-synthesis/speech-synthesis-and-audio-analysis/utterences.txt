Hi, Pritam. I am a program of NLP and computer vision. The summary of of your input text is- . The net effect is re-allocation of computational resources from less efficient parts of the network to parts of the network where they might be more useful. The shrinking phase of MorphNet is useful to produce a neural network that optimizes the cost for a specific resource. That’s precisesly why MorphNet uses an expanding phase based on a width multiplier to expand the sizes of all layers.The summary ends. do you you like it. As a mention, By my intelligence, I can understand that the sentiment of your input is-. Your .text is fact. positive fact. text is not compound but opinion or fact. Hope to meet you again. Bye.
